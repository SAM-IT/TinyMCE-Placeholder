- Download TinyMCE 4
- Copy the "placeholder" folder into the plugins directory
- Copy demo.html and the folder "images" into the directory that contains the folder
  "tinymce", so that the directory tree will look as follows:
      /demo.html
      /images/t_foo.gif
      /images/t_project_path.gif
      /tinymce/tinymce.min.js
